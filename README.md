This project is created for the Practical Python and Data-Centric Development module at the **Full Stack Software Development Course** with **Code Institute**.

***

**The brief** 

_Project purpose_: In this project, you'll build a full-stack site that allows your users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain.

_Main Technologies Required_: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask, MongoDB.

_Optional_: Additional libraries and external APIs.

_Value provided_:

1. Users make use of the site to share their own data with the community, and benefit from having convenient access to the data provided by all other members.
2. The site owner advances their own goals by providing this functionality, potentially by being a regular user themselves. The site owner might also benefit from the collection of the dataset as a whole.

**THE IDEA**

_click a book_ is a books review website where users can share their love for reading by adding new books and review books.

 I have chose this theme for the website because I like reading books and I think I can understand better how a user will navigate the site and what are their expectations when they open the website. 

### The need:

Music lovers who want to know the exact lyrics of a song. Could be just as a curiosity and knowledge or even for a karaoke session.

### The goals of this website are:

* Provide a clean feel and easy to navigate website, on mobile and desktop;
* Offer a wide range of lyrics to the user;

***

###  UX

Common characteristics of a user:

* Avid reader who likes discovering new books, sharing their reading list and review books.

#### Design and colors

##### Fonts

For logo I have used two fonts: _Merryweather_ and _Old Standard_ to emphasise the word _book_.

I have used two fonts, _Open Sans_ for general text displayed on the site. It's easy to read and looks good on all devices. Where I need to put more emphasis on a piece of text, I have used Libre Baskerville. Because is a books/reading related website, I think it fits well with the theme.

##### Color Scheme

I wanted the user to get a sense of calmness and warmth when they open the website. To invite them to think about the feel and look of the books they have read or they will like to read. 

They background, I have started trying different colors for the text.
I have used the website [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) to create the color scheme. I have used #DCC48E ![#DCC48E](https://placehold.it/15/DCC48E/000000?text=+) , #F6FEDB ![#F6FEDB](https://placehold.it/15/F6FEDB/000000?text=+),  #6C5A49![#6C5A49](https://placehold.it/15/6C5A49/000000?text=+), #F0B67F![#F0B67F](https://placehold.it/15/F0B67F/000000?text=+) , #AF9164![#AF9164](https://placehold.it/15/AF9164/000000?text=+) as main colors,

#### Design wireframes / mock-ups:

The home page will have images with books from different genres, a search bar to find books and review

Click on the below links to see the wireframes or you can view them in the  [wireframes]() folder.

#### Initial Wireframes

* **[Desktop view](https://github.com/andreeaiosip/click-a-book/tree/master/documentation/wireframes/desktop)**


#### Client stories:

* As a _general user_ I would like to get a clean and calm feel of the website when I open it.

* As a _general user_, I want to be able to create an account with password protected.

* *As a registered user*, I want to navigate my way easy on the website, to browse around through the content.

* As a _registered user_ I would like to be able to look up for a book quickly using the keywords as the book title, author or genre.

* As a _registered user_ I would like to be able to log in and log from my account to keep it secure and private.

* As a _registered user_ I would like to be able to delete my account at any point.

* As a _registered user_ I would like to be able to share my reviews on books.

* As a _registered user_ I would like to be able to view, delete and edit/update any review I have posted on the web app.

* As a _registered user_ I would like to be able to vote for a book that I liked.

* As a _registered user_ I would like to be able to see all the content I have posted on the web app on my personal profile page.
