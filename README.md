***

This project is created for the Practical Python and Data-Centric Development module at the **Full Stack Software Development Course** with **Code Institute**.

**The brief** 

_Project purpose_: In this project, you'll build a full-stack site that allows your users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain.

_Main Technologies Required_: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask, MongoDB.

_Optional_: Additional libraries and external APIs.

_Value provided_:

1. Users make use of the site to share their own data with the community, and benefit from having convenient access to the data provided by all other members.
2. The site owner advances their own goals by providing this functionality, potentially by being a regular user themselves. The site owner might also benefit from the collection of the dataset as a whole.

**THE IDEA**

_click a book_ is a website of a book club set up by the founders of the book club. They post suggestions of books for the next meetup and members can log in and pick the book they are interested in reading for the next meetup.

 I have chose this theme for the website because I like reading books and I think I can understand better how a user will navigate the site and what are their expectations when they open the website. 

### The need:

The book club founder wants to have a platform where the book club members can see her book suggestions for the next meetup. This way they can pick their favourite and they can comment on it why they would like to read that book.

### The goals of this website are:

* The books  on the website are posted by the book club founder through the MongoDB Database and fetched on the website.
*  Provide a choice of books to the book club members, so they can pick which book they would like to read for their next book club meetup.
* Only registered  members can see the comments posted by other users or post their comments  on the site.
* Provide a clean feel and easy to navigate website, on all screen sizes.

###  UX

Common characteristics of a user:

* Avid reader who likes discovering new books, sharing their reading list and review books.
* Book club member or someone who is interested in joining the book club.

#### Design and colours

##### Fonts

For logo I have used two fonts: _Merryweather_ and _Old Standard_ to emphasise the word _book_.

I have used two fonts, _Open Sans_ for general text displayed on the site. It's easy to read and looks good on all devices. Where I need to put more emphasis on a piece of text, I have used Libre Baskerville. Because is a books/reading related website, I think it fits well with the theme.

##### Colour Scheme

I wanted the user to get a sense of calmness and warmth when they open the website. To invite them to think about the feel and look of the books they have read or they will like to read. 
I have used the website [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) to create the colour scheme. I have used #e3c6b9 ![##e3c6b9](https://placehold.it/15/e3c6b9/000000?text=+) , #F6FEDB ![#F6FEDB](https://placehold.it/15/F6FEDB/000000?text=+), \#f4f4f4![#f4f4f4](https://placehold.it/15/f4f4f4/000000?text=+) as main colours. 

These colours bring a sense of calmness and cleanness for the reader to put them in a peaceful  state when they read through the website.
