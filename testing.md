I have used Responsinator to see how the site looks like on different screens. Please see here [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fclick-a-book.herokuapp.com%2F).

I wanted to check how the page looks on different browsers for Windows and iOS, so I have used [crossbrowsertesting.com](https://app.crossbrowsertesting.com/test-center). I have only been able to take screenshots of what test I have performed, because you need to buy a licence to be able to download the results. Please see below the types of test I have performed.
